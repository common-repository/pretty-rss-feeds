Transforms the in-browser view of feeds to make them user-friendly.

== Description ==

This plugin improves the default in-browser view of feeds to make them user-friendly. It makes it easier for human readers and adds a link to [Aboutfeeds.com](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to introduce new users to feeds.

The plugin uses `pretty-feed.xsl` to transform the feeds. 

== Installation ==

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

It adds a stylesheet to apply a visual transformation to the default feed view. The stylesheet adjusts the default in-browser feed view to provide information about what a feed is and how they work.

= Are there any limitations? =

From the developer of the `pretty-feed` stylesheet:

> Styling the feed *prevents* the browser from automatically opening a newsreader application. This is a trade off, but it's a benefit to new users who won't have a newsreader installed, and they are saved from seeing or downloaded obscure XML content. For existing newsreader users, they will know to copy-and-paste the feed URL, and they get the benefit of an in-browser feed preview.
